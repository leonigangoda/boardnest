# BoardNest
> A verified student boarding platform for Sri Lanka

BoardNest connects university students with landlords offering verified, trustworthy accommodation. Every listing is physically inspected by a Field Agent and approved by an Admin before it goes live — replacing informal channels like Facebook groups and word-of-mouth with a structured, accountable platform.

## Features

**Students** — Browse verified listings publicly without an account. Search by city, KM radius from a landmark, or proximity to a university with area saturation data. Filter by price, gender preference, room type, and rating. Book individual room slots, track booking status, leave reviews, and file complaints.

**Landlords** — Register properties and rooms, manage booking requests, track verification status per listing, and manage subscription tiers (Standard / Pro) with PayHere.

**Field Agents** — Receive verification task assignments for their city, complete GPS-gated on-site inspection checklists, submit verification reports, investigate complaints, and submit area reports.

**Admin** — Approve listings and registrations, manage field agents, moderate complaints and reviews, publish area profiles, and configure commission and subscription settings.
